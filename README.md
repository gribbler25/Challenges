# Code Refactor Starter Code
HORISEON WEBSITE CODE REFACTOR

What:  A first code refactor project with the goal of improving the source code, HTML and CSS,
        to provide better semantic HTML and image description for users with accessibility tools such as screen readers and also to provide more concise, effective use of classes in CSS so the code is grouped logically and without redundancy.

Why:  To improve a website's accessibility and efficacy of its source code.

How:  This project was accomplished through careful study of UW Coding Bootcamp Module 1 
        and emulation of the CSS and HTML techniques taught therein.
